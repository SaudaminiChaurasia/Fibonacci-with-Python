# Fibonacci-with-Python
Fibonacci generator:
The python program implements a recursive function to generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence was developed by the Italian mathematician, Leonardo Fibonacci, in the 13th century. The sequence of numbers, starting with zero and one, is a steadily increasing series where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.
